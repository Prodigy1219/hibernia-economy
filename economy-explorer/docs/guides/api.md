# Using the economy API

The economy has a **REST API** so you can build your own apps and integrations against
your Treasury accounts — check balances, read transaction history, and move money. This
guide gets you from nothing to your first authenticated request.

> [!NOTE]
> This page is for **developers**. If you just want to view your own data on the
> website, you don't need any of this — see
> [Using the Explorer](/docs/guides/using-the-explorer) instead.

## The interactive reference (Swagger)

Every endpoint, with request/response schemas and a built-in "try it out", lives in the
Swagger UI. Open the one for **your** server:

> [!TIP]
> **Open the API reference:**
> - [DemocracyCraft API reference](https://api.democracycraft.net/economy/swagger-ui/index.html)
> - [StateCraft API reference](https://api.mcstatecraft.com/economy/swagger-ui/index.html)
>
> Use the one matching the server you play on.

The base URL for requests is the same prefix:

| Server | Base URL |
|---|---|
| DemocracyCraft | `https://api.democracycraft.net/economy` |
| StateCraft | `https://api.mcstatecraft.com/economy` |

## Step 1 — Get an API key in-game

Keys are issued **in Minecraft**, not on the website. Each key is a token scoped to a
single account, so the API can only touch the account you issued it for.

For your **personal** account:

```text
/treasuryapi personal issue
```

The plugin replies with the new key's ID and the **token** itself (click it in chat to
copy). For a **firm** account, issue a business key instead:

```text
/treasuryapi business issue Acme
```

> [!WARNING]
> The token is shown **once**, when it's issued. Copy it somewhere safe. You can
> re-retrieve it later with `/treasuryapi personal export <keyId>` (it gives you a
> shareable link to the token), or replace it with `/treasuryapi personal reissue
> <keyId>`.

Manage your keys any time:

```text
/treasuryapi personal list            # your keys and their IDs
/treasuryapi personal revoke <keyId>  # kill a key immediately
```

Business keys have the same `list` / `export` / `reissue` / `revoke` subcommands under
`/treasuryapi business`. Firm staff can also run `/treasuryapi business list access` to
see the keys issued for firms they're employed at.

## Step 2 — Authenticate

Send the token as a **Bearer** token in the `Authorization` header on every request:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

The token is a JWT scoped to one account and valid for **180 days**. Keep it secret — a
valid token can move that account's money.

## Step 3 — Make a request

For example, read an account's transaction history (replace the host with your server's
base URL and `<accountId>` with your account):

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://api.democracycraft.net/economy/api/v1/accounts/<accountId>/transactions"
```

From there, the [Swagger reference](#the-interactive-reference-swagger) is the
authoritative list of endpoints and exact request bodies. The core capabilities are:

- **Transfers** — move money to a player or to a firm.
- **Transactions** — read an account's history.
- **Balance** — read an account's current balance.
- **Baltop** — the richest players, ranked (the same list as `/baltop` in-game).
- **Webhooks** — get a signed POST when the account moves money, instead of polling (see
  the [Webhooks guide](/docs/guides/webhooks)).
- **Token rotation** — refresh your token before it expires.

> [!NOTE]
> Requests are **rate-limited** per key. Swagger shows each endpoint's limit; if you go
> over, you'll get an HTTP `429` and should back off and retry.

## Keeping a token alive

Rather than re-issuing in-game every time, an app can **rotate** its token through the
API before the 180-day expiry — see the auth endpoints in Swagger. If a token is ever
leaked, revoke it immediately in-game with `/treasuryapi personal revoke <keyId>` and
issue a fresh one.

## Security checklist

- Treat the token like a password — it can spend the account's money.
- Never commit it to source control or paste it into a public channel.
- Use a **separate key per app** so you can revoke one without breaking the others.
- Revoke keys you no longer use.

## Where to go next

- The full endpoint reference and "try it out": the Swagger links
  [above](#the-interactive-reference-swagger).
- **[Webhooks](/docs/guides/webhooks)** — react to transactions in real time instead of
  polling.
- How accounts and money work behind the API:
  [Accounts & money](/docs/concepts/accounts-and-money).
